# Application of Neural Networks for Climate Downscaling

## Introduction

Climate data downscaling is a process of estimating the impact of climate change at a local scale by combining large-scale climate models with high-resolution observations. The data folder for this application contains the following data:

- Elevation data at high resolution
- High- and low-fidelity temperature data
- Low-resolution wind data

The purpose of this project is to use python scripts to estimate high-fidelity wind data (u10 and v10) using neural networks. 

## Data Source

The data used in this project is taken from [https://github.com/scotthosking/mf_modelling](https://github.com/scotthosking/mf_modelling). 

## Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of neural networks in downscaling climate data, which is an important step in understanding the impact of climate change at a local scale.
